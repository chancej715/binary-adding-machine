# Binary Adding Machine
JavaScript implementation of the binary adding machine described in chapter twelve of "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" by Charles Petzold.

# Description
Add two 8-bit binary numbers that can range from 0000 0000 through 1111 1111 (0 through 255 in decimal).

The sum of two 8-bit numbers can be as high as 1-1111-1110 (510 in decimal).

## Important Points
- The AND gate calculates a carry bit for the addition of two binary digits.
- The XOR gate calculates the sum bit.
